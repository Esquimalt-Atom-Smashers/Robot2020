**Step 1**

Make sure you have the WPILib version of Visual Studio Code running on your computer

**Step 2**

Download and run the exe for the [CTRE Phoenix Library](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Releases/releases/tag/v5.19.4.1).
If Windows tells you "This program could be harmful to your device" click "More Info" then "Run Anyway".

Once you reach this screen select only roboRIO-FRC -> C++/Java.

Once you've finished the installation close and reopen VS Code then run the ">Manage Vendor Libraries" command and the ">Install Libraries (Offline)" command. At this point there should be a list of libraries to install, check the one titled "Phoenix" then press enter.

The code should compile successfully.
